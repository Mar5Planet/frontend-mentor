# frontend-mentor

Frontend Mentor Design challenges are created to test a developer's responsive website design capabilities. The wireframe and application attributes are provided by the Frontend Mentor UI/UX team. The goal of the developer is to create a live version of the web-application wireframes. The purpose of this demo is to showcase my responsive and functional design skills. All applications are built with Vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
